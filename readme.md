<img src="" alt="shapes game">

## Premise
Shapes is a 'hole-in-the-wall' style game.  The aim is to fit your shape inside the hole when time the time runs out.

## Brief
To build a browser-based game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Technologies used
* HTML5
* CSS, **SCSS**, **Gulp**
* JavaScript, **JQuery**

## Features
Shapes features a timer, x/y position mapping and manipulation and element rotation (controlled and automatic) in its game logic.  Other features include start and end game menus, a non-persistent high score record, animated gif instructions and background and triggered audio.

## Challenges
The primary challenge with Shapes was in programming the win condition.  Adding rotation to the target hole made an otherwise simple task highly complex.  The reason for this was the way the win condition was measured, checking the x/y position of the hole (specifically its top left corner) and comparing this with the x/y position of the shape (also its top left corner). ...
